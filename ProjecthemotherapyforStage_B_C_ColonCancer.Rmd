# Objectives  
We wish to confirm using our own process that adjuvant therapy with the combination of levamisole and fluorouracil significantly reduce death within 5 years compared with no adjuvant therapy – using only levamisole.  We chose to only include these two groups because we are only comparing adjuvant therapy against normal therapy.  Levimasole is already recognized worldwide as an antiparasitic drug that changes ones immune response, similar to methotrexate – so we are considering it a control.  We aim to achieve this by:<br>

1.  To assess the distributions of variables within the two treatment categories, including: (distribution plots/tables between groups)  
    a.	Sex – Male or female patients  
    b.	Age – Finding the average (or median) age that has most impact on 5 year survival  
    c.	Obstructive tumours versus non-obstructive  
    d.	If the colon was perforated by the tumor or not  
    e.	If tumors were adhered to nearby organs  
    f.	Differentiation of tumors – rated well, moderate, or poor  
    g.	The extent of local spread of the tumor which could be:  
        i.	Submucosal  
        ii.	Within muscle  
        iii.	Within the serosa – the outermost layer of organs  
        iv.	Contiguous structures – meaning nearby organs  
2.  Investigate if any of the predictor variables have an impact on each other. (correlation)(VIF)  
3.  Using stepwise regression to obtain a model that best describes the impact of specific variables on five year life status  
4.	Using a logistic regression model to investigate the association between five year life status and one or more categorical predictor variables within each treatment group (regression models for both groups) (predict) (train+test) (residuals)  
5.	Assessing whether there are differences in survival (or cumulative incidence of event) among different groups of participants  
    a.  This will be done by testing the null hypothesis of no difference in survival between two or more independent groups.  
        i.	H0: The two survival rates are identical, (α=0.05).    
        ii.	Ha: The two survival rates are not identical.  (chi-square test)  
6.	Analyze data within the subset of Levamisole-fluorouracil to find which variables have the greatest impact on 5 year mortality.  (Reliampo)

</style>
<div class = "blue">

**Preliminary Findings:**

Below are the preliminary findings after reading the graphs and reports produced by methods (Xray, Datamaid) used above.

* Data has total of 614 observations.

* Below variables are already recoded to factor and a new variables are named as variablename.factor. These factor recoded variables are used in the analysis below.
   * Obstruct
   * differ
   * mort_5 yr
   * Sex
   * Rx
   * Perfor
   * Adhere
   * Extent
   * Age

* Some preliminary observations for the variables used in the analysis below:
    
   * Age Group - Majorirty of the observation belongs to 60+ age group.
   * Extent - Majority of the observation belongs to Extent group.
   * Adhere - Majority of the observation is "No" for adherence.
   * Perforance - Majority of the observations is "No" while a very few observations belong to "Yes".
   * Differ - Majority of the observations belong to the "Moderate" differentiation category.
   * Mort_5 yr - Majority of the observations belong to "Alive". There are some NA in this column.

## Missing Values and Treatment

In this section, the total count of missing values in each column is identified and further treated by replacing them with the most frequently occurring value for that variable. *Note* - Zeros are not treated as part of treating missing values as zeros are one of the valid response outputs.

### Total Count of Missing Values

The summary table below provides total count of NA for all the variables along with other information like minimum value, Max.value, Mean, Median etc. From the table below it is identified 6 of the variables contain NAs that need to be treated for further analysis.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(colon.data)
```

Below is the table of all the variables with the totalcount of NAs. 

```{r}
MD <- colSums(is.na(colon.data))
library(kableExtra)
MD %>%
  kable(caption = "Table 3: Total count of NA for each variable") %>%
  kable_styling( bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left", fixed_thead = T)

# Logistic Regression using Five Year Mortality

We decided to use mort_5yr as the response variable.

## Split the data into train and test set  
```{r}
library(rsample)
set.seed(78)
train_test_split <- initial_split(colon.data, prop=0.7)
train <- training(train_test_split)
test <- testing(train_test_split)
(samp <- dim(train_test_split))
```

## NULL model  
**TODO** interpretation of the intercept

```{r}
null_model <- glm(mort_5yr ~ 1, family= binomial(logit), data = train)
summary(null_model)
```

## Use all the variables to perform a logistic regression   
The treatment seems to be the only predictor of the 5 year life status. 

```{r}
model_training <- glm(mort_5yr ~ rx + sex + age + obstruct + perfor + adhere + differ + extent, family= binomial(logit), data = train)
summary(model_training)
```

## Use the extent of tumor as predictor  
**TODO** Interpretation of the result

```{r}
model_training_rx_only <- glm(mort_5yr ~ rx, family= binomial(logit), data = train)
summary(model_training_rx_only)
```

## Analysis to see if the treatment make a difference in   
**TODO** explain p nd chi-square values

```{r}
library(sjPlot)
tab_xtab(colon.data$mort_5yr, colon.data$rx , show.col.prc=TRUE, show.row.prc=TRUE, var.labels=c("Life status After 5 year", "Treatment"))
```

## Multicollinearity. 
No multicollinearity is required here, as only one predictor was required.

## Anova.  
Here I build the NULL model using the training data set, and I use ANOVA to check if the 2 models deviance are significantly different.

The ANOVA test below indicates that the combined Lev+5FU treatment has a significant impact on the 5 year life status at the 1% level of risk.

```{r}
anova(model_training_rx_only, null_model, test ="Chisq")
```

## Predict against test data. 
```{r}
test_results <- predict(model_training_rx_only, newdata=test)
```

## Hit Ratio. 
**TODO** Not working and I couldn't figure out why...
```{r}
predicted.prob <- predict( model_training_rx_only, newdata=test, type = "response")
str(predicted.prob)
```

```{r}
library(forcats)
predicted.classes <- as.factor( ifelse( predicted.prob > 0.5, "Alive", "Death" ) )
predicted.classes <- fct_relevel( (predicted.classes) , c("Alive","Death" ) )
# tab_xtab(test$mort_5yr, predicted.classes, var.labels = c("Actual Life status", "Predicted life status"), show.row.prc = TRUE)

# Reducing the model to those variables able to predict well

There are two primary ways to reduce the size of a predictive model based on statistical analysis: 

__1__ Delete those variables that have p-values greater than 0.05; 

__2__ Delete those variables having dangerously high multicollinearity.


# Investigation of Multicollinearity (high correlation among the predictors)

</div>


Multicollinearity is the occurrence of high intercorrelations among two or more independent variables in a multiple regression model.
Multicollinearity in a multiple regression model indicates that collinear independent variables are related in some fashion, although the relationship may or may not be casual.

<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">

___Importance of Investigation of Multicollinearity___

</div>


Multicollinearity reduces the precision of the estimate coefficients, which weakens the statistical power of the regression model. Hence, we may not be able to trust the p-values to identify independent variables that are statistically significant. 

Before beginning the regression, the correlations below may provide some insights.
__The correlation coefficient__ indicates the strength of the linear relationship that might be existing between two variables.


# Relative Importance of Predictors (Drivers)

The table below presents all of the relative importance metrics from ‘relaimpo’. 
 
The second block gives the coefficients when 1 predictor is entered, 2 are entered through to all 11 predictors.


```{r}
library(relaimpo) 
imp.lm<-calc.relimp(RegModel.1, type=c("lmg"), rela = TRUE)
imp.lm
```


```{r}
rel.lmg<- calc.relimp(RegModel.1, type="lmg")
pm<- data.frame(rel.lmg$lmg, rel.lmg$lmg.rank)
pm<-pm[order(rel.lmg$lmg.rank),]
pm <-data.frame(Features=rownames(pm), pm, row.names=NULL)
colnames(pm) <- c("Features", "Importance", "Rankings")
is.num <- sapply(pm, is.numeric)
pm[is.num] <- lapply( pm[is.num], round, 3)
tab_df(pm)
```


The tables above answer the question of 

__What are the key drivers of mort_5yr:	5 years life status ?__

# Reducing the model to significant predictors


# Stepwise Regression
```{r}
library(MASS)  
#step <- stepAIC(RegModel.1, direction="both", na.omit=TRUE)
#step
```



The stepwise regression (or stepwise selection) consists of iteratively adding and removing predictors, in the predictive model, in order to find the subset of variables in the data set resulting in the best performing model, that is a model that lowers prediction error.

__Stepwise selection (or sequential replacement), which is a combination of forward and backward selections___. It starts with no predictors, then sequentially adds the most contributive predictors (like forward selection). After adding each new variable, any variables that no longer provide an improvement in the model fit are removed. (like backward selection). 
It stops when a model is obtained where all predictors are statistically significant.

The AIC at the top of each regression is the ___Akaike Information Criterion___. It compares the quality of a set of statistical models to each other. We only compare AIC value whether it is increasing or decreasing by adding more variables. Also in case of multiple models, the one which has lower AIC value is preferred.

However, AIC will choose the best model from a set, it won’t say anything about absolute quality.Therefore, once the best model has been selected, a hypothesis test will be run to figure out the relationship between the variables in the model selected and mort_5yr: 5 years life status

# Stating and testing the Hypothesis for the variables (rx.factor + age.factor + differ.factor + extent.factor) in the model selected (best model)

__$H_o$__: the coefficients of the variables in the the best model are equal to zero, statistically, at a risk of a Type 1 error, = $\alpha = 0.05$

The smallest possible value of VIF is 1 (absence of multicollinearity). As a rule of thumb, a VIF value that exceeds 4 indicates a problematic amount of collinearity amongst the variables.

__Importance of Splitting the dataset into a training sample and a testing sample__

</div>

Cross-validation refers to a set of methods for measuring the performance of a given predictive model on new test data sets.
The basic idea, behind cross-validation techniques, consists of dividing the data into two sets:

__The training set__, used to train (i.e. build) the model;

__the testing set (or validation set)__ , used to test (i.e. validate) the model by estimating the prediction error.

The model will attempt to learn the relationship on the training data and be evaluated on the test data.
Cross-validation is primarily used in to estimate the skill of a model on unseen data. That is, to use a limited sample in order to estimate how the model is expected to perform in general when used to make predictions on data not used during the training of the model.
Overfitting and underfitting is a fundamental problem that trips up even experienced data analysts. The developed model may look great, but the problem is if a testing set is never used, the model is nothing more than an overfit representation of the training data. Thus the model does not work when someone else tries to apply it to a new data.

___How good is the model?___

I’ve built a model, investigated statistical properties, considered the relative importance of the predictors and reduced the model to those most important predictors that are significantly related to the response variable. Now, we need to further investigate model quality and usability.Quality of regression models can be judged in many ways. In this case it will be done by splitting the dataset randomly into a training sample (70% of total observations) on which the model will be re-developed and a testing sample, sometimes called the holdout sample, on which the quality of predictions is tested.

# Reducing the model, using Stepwise Regression, to those variables having coefficients significantly different from zero

Since the variable 'Rural' has coefficient that __is  significantly not different from zero (p (sig) = 0.058 > 0.05)__. Hence __$H_o$__ cannot be rejected in this case. 

The stepwise regression was used to find the "best training model" with subset of predictor variables that are statistically significant.

```{r}

```
In case of current stepwise regression for LifeExpectancy using the Training Sample, the model with variables 'BirthRate', 'GDP' , 'Health' , 'HIV' , 'Rural' has been chosen as the best training model. 
The “plotreg()” function is used below to present the coefficient estimates based on the training sample. The graphs show that, while the intercept is not significantly different from zero, all the five predictor variables significantly help to improve prediction of LifeExpectancy.

# Testing if the distribution of the residuals is normal

__Stating Null and Alternative Hypothesis:__ 

$H_o$: Distribution of residuals is Normal , risk of a Type 1 error = $\alpha = 0.05$.   

$H_a:$ Distribution of residuals is not Normal

```{r  fig.width=5, fig.height=5 }
library("car")
qqPlot(model.tr, main="QQ Plot") 
```


The plot above shows the distribution of the residuals against the expected normal distribution. For normally distributed data, observations should lie approximately on the reference line. Since, there are some (approximately 4) outliers in the data (points at the ends of the line distanced from the bulk of the observations and the reference line) the residuals may not be normally distributed. Hence, further investigation is required. 

*******

In the density plots below, we attempt to visualize the underlying probability distribution of the residuals by drawing an appropriate continuous curve. 
Residuals do not seem to be normally distributed as residuals are not symmetric about the mean and show bimodality. It should be further investigated by the conducting Normality testing.

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA, include=FALSE}
d <- densityPlot(residual)
```
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, comment=NA}

polygon(d, col="orange", border="green")
```

__Testing the hypothesis using Shapiro-Wilk’s method__

Shapiro-Wilk’s method has been used to test the normality of Residuals, considering a significance level of 0.05. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, comment=NA}
shapiro.test((residual))
```



# How Important Are Normal Residuals in Regression Analysis?

Prediction intervals are calculated based on the assumption that the residuals are normally distributed. If the residuals are non-normal, the prediction intervals may be inaccurate, affecting the reliability and usability of the model.
Moreover, while building a optimally fitting linear model, it is assumed that the relationship is linear, and that the errors, or residuals, are simply random fluctuations around the true line. If residuals are not (approximately) normally distributed (with a mean of zero), it can pinpoint potential issues with the model.

## 2.e. Testing homoscedasticity and Stating hypotheses. 

The assumption of homoscedasticity (meaning “same variance”) is central to linear regression models.  Homoscedasticity describes a situation in which the error term (that is, the “noise” or random disturbance in the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable) is the same across all values of the independent variables. 

Homoscedasticity in the best model  is tested below using the Breusch Pagan Test. It tests whether variances of residuals from a regression are dependent on the values of an independent variable.

__Stating Null and Alternative Hypothesis:__ 

$H_o:$ there are equal or constant variances,  $\alpha$ = 0.05

$H_a:$ there are unequal or non-constant variances

# 2.f. Using the model based on the training sample to predict mort_5yr:5 years life status for those in the testing sample. How good is the model based on the training sample when used on the testing sample data? 

## Predicting mort_5yr:5 years life status using the training model on the testing dataset

“predict()” evaluates the model equation on values of rx.factor + age.factor + differ.factor + extent.factor for each respondent in the testing sample. While the model was based on those respondents in the training sample, the respondents in the testing sample did not contribute to those calculations and can be considered to be “fresh” or “new” subjects.

__The code-chunk below predicts the mort_5yr:5 years life status for the test, or holdout, sample of patients using the model built on the training data.__

```{r}
model.te<-lm(mort_5yr.num ~ rx.factor + age.factor + differ.factor + extent.factor, test)
predicted.tr.te <- predict(model.tr, newdata=test  )
predicted.tr.te
actual <- test$ mort_5yr.num # actual attitudes for the testing sample
x<- as.data.frame(cbind(actual, predicted.tr.te)) 
```

### Assessing the model based on the training sample when used on the testing sample data. 

#### Scatter plots of Predicted vs Actual

```{r,  fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
scatterplot(x$predicted~x$actual, regLine=TRUE, smooth=FALSE, boxplots=FALSE, data=colon.data,col = "red", main = "Scatterplot of Predicted vs Actual " ,xlab = "Actual",ylab = "Predicted")
```

Scatter plots of Predicted vs Actual is used to understand how well the regression model makes predictions for different response values.  A perfect regression model has a predicted response equal to the true response, so all the points lie on a diagonal line. The vertical distance from the line to any point is the error of the prediction for that point. A good model has small errors, and so the predictions are scattered near the line.

Hence, it may be concluded that the model has a weak Goodness of fit since most of the points are foggy or dispersed (away from the diagonal line). 

The analysis above, further mandates the assessment of goodness of the model based on the training sample when used on the testing sample data. 

# Correlation between actual and predicted values of the dependent variable, Life Expectancy

___Stating the Hypothesis___

Ho: correlation = 0 i.e., actual and predicted values of the dependent variable, Life Expectancy, are __statistically independent__, a risk of a Type 1 error, = α=0.05

Ha: correlation ≠ 0 i.e., actual and predicted values of the dependent variable, Life Expectancy, are __statistically correlated__ , a risk of a Type 1 error, = α=0.05 are correlated a risk of a Type 1 error, = α=0.05

___Testing Hypothesis___


```{r,  fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
( c<- cor.test(x$actual,x$predicted))
library(sjPlot)
tab_corr(x, digits=2, show.p=TRUE, p.numeric=TRUE)
```

___Interpretations___

From the analysis above, it can be inferred that actual and predicted values of the dependent variable, Life Expectancy, are significantly correlated (r = 0.9052694 , p = 0.00000009964). Since p = 0.00000009964 < 0.05, the null hypotheses can be rejected. Also, the confidence interval does not include 0.

# Global test of model assumptions using the ‘gvlma’ package

The ‘gvlma’ package provides a summary assessment of the assumptions for a linear model and they are below for the testing model.
```{r,  fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
pacman::p_load(gvlma)
gvmodel <- gvlma(model.te) 
summary(gvmodel)
```

___Interpretations___

The summary above provides the following information: 

The intercept with a value of 76.57593133 is well above the origin i.e., the regression line does not pass through the origin.

GDP & Health variables have positive coefficients which indicate direct impact on the dependent variable, LifeExpectancy, whereas HIV, Rural and BirthRate have negative coefficients which indicate inverse relationship with the dependent variable, LifeExpectancy. 

The t-statistic/t-value is just the estimated coefficient divided by its own standard error. Thus, it measures “how many standard deviations from zero” the estimated coefficient is.

From the p value of 0.000002631 we can estimate that statistically intercept goes beyond zero and can reject the null hypotheses that the line intercepts the vertical axis at the origin, α = 0.05.

Also , from the p value of  0.000002631 we can estimate that statistically coefficient of correlation is not equal to zero. Hence, at a risk of a Type 1 error, = α=0.05 and p value <0.05, we can reject the Ho that correlation = 0 and conclude that correlation ≠ 0 i.e., 

The regression model is  very well able to predict the dependent variable, Life Expectancy	[Average life expectancy (years)]  

Moreover, The ‘gvlma’ test provides a lot of output for the regression and then states whether 5 assumptions are acceptable or not. In this case, all assumptions pass the tests except for the link function which indicates that we should use an alternative form of the generalized linear model (e.g. logistic or binomial regression).

```

summary(surv.colon)
```
Corresponding graph. 

```{r }
plot(surv.colon,  xlab="Days till death", ylab="Survival Probability")
title("Survival curves for colon data, Null model")
```


Since RX treatment has not been entered into the model above, the table and graph above convey that the probabilities of survival from colon cancer at each point in time (days). the lower the days, the higher probability of survival. at 23 days time, we had 614 people at risk with a 98% chance of survival. However as we go up in days, the chances of survival go down. We see this illistrated in both the graph and table. For example, at 797 days time, we had 469 peoples chances of survival at below 76%.

## Survival model for the rx treatment on all cases

```{r }
surv.colon <- survfit(Surv(time,status) ~ rx, conf.int=TRUE, data = colon.data)
summary(surv.colon)
```
```{r }
plot(surv.colon, lty = c(2,1), xlab="days till death", ylab="Survival Probability")
legend(13, .4, c("Probability of survival: Lev treatment"), lty = 2 ) 
legend(13,.9, c("Probability of survival: Lev+5FU treatment"), lty = 1) 
title("Survival curves for colon cancer data")
```


Above we see the survival analysis divided into two groups. Group one being the Lev treatment and group 2 being the Lev+5FU treatment. Some observations include:

For the Lev treatment group, in 93 days time, 308 people had survived and were at risk with a 99% chance of survival. 

For the Lev+5FU treatment group, in 79 days time, 300 people had survived and were at risk with a 98% chance of survival.

## Test statistically if the two treatments are the same or different.

Let's define our hypotheses

Ho: There's no difference between the Lev treatment and Lev+5FU treatment.

Ha: There is a difference 

Alpha: .05

```{r }
survdiff(Surv(time, status)~ rx, data=colon.data, rho=0)
```

Above we see a chi square value of 8.2 and a p value of .004. We do reject the null hypothesis as the p-value is .004 and well below our threshold of .05. This means there is a significant difference between the Lev treatment and Lev+5FU colon cancer patients.
